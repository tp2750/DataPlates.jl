# DataPlates

Documentation for [DataPlates](https://github.com/tp2750/DataPlates.jl).

DataPlates is a Julia package for working with data on SBS or microtiter (MTP) plates.
This is a rewrite of [MTP.jl](https://github.com/tp2750/MTP.jl) which was never registered.

Packages for similar use-cases exist in R: https://github.com/ropensci/plater, https://github.com/jpquast/ggplate
